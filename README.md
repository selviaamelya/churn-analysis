# Churn Analysis
Customer churn (or customer attrition) refers to the loss of customers or subscribers, regardless of the reason. This can occur after a certain period of subscribing to a product, which may include goods or services such as internet networks, telecommunications providers, and similar offerings. In this context, the focus is on a telecommunications company.

The churn process can be described in several stages. The first stage is when customers initially subscribe to the product. The second stage involves routine interactions, such as customer behavior or feedback regarding the product over a specific period. Following this, the third stage has two possible outcomes: retention (renewing the subscription) or churn (switching to a competitor or discontinuing the subscription).

Every company strives to minimize churn and maximize retention. One effective solution is to use customer churn prediction. By leveraging predictive analytics, companies can identify characteristics and patterns that indicate a higher likelihood of customers switching or discontinuing their subscriptions, enabling proactive measures to retain them.
